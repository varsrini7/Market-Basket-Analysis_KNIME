# Market-Basket-Analysis_KNIME

The aim is to identify the most popular combos that can be suggested to the Grocery Store chain after a thorough analysis of the most commonly occurring sets of menu items in the customer orders. The Store doesn’t have any combo meals and hence the best combo meals are suggested. The problem is based on Market Basket Analysis. I have done it using Python, KNIME, Tableau and Jupyter Notebook. A PPT and the dataset are also included.
